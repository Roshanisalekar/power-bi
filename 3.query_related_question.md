🔍 Basic Power Query Interview/Practice Questions
❓Q1: What is Power Query and how is it different from DAX?
Answer:
Power Query is used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) before data enters the Power BI data model.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used after data is loaded — to create measures, calculated columns, and advanced analytics.

❓Q2: Does Power Query alter the original data source?
Answer:
No. Power Query is non-destructive. It reads the data, transforms it in memory, and loads the cleaned version into Power BI. The original source remains untouched.

❓Q3: What language does Power Query use?
Answer:
Power Query uses a language called M (Mashup) — a case-sensitive functional language used to define data transformation steps.

❓Q4: What is the difference between Merge and Append in Power Query?
Answer:

Merge: Joins two tables side-by-side (like SQL JOIN or VLOOKUP) using a key column.

Append: Stacks tables vertically (like SQL UNION) when they have the same structure.

❓Q5: What is the difference between “Close” and “Close & Apply” in Power BI?
Answer:

Close just closes the Power Query Editor without applying changes.

Close & Apply applies all transformation steps and loads the data into Power BI’s data model.

🧠 Intermediate-Level Power Query Questions
❓Q6: What is an “Applied Step” in Power Query?
Answer:
Each action you take (like renaming a column or filtering rows) becomes an Applied Step — listed on the right panel. Power Query processes them in sequence, and they can be edited or removed.

❓Q7: What happens if you reorder Applied Steps?
Answer:
Power Query may throw errors or behave differently if you change step order, especially if later steps depend on earlier ones (e.g., removing a column before a step that uses that column).

❓Q8: What is the purpose of “Unpivot” in Power Query?
Answer:
“Unpivot” transforms wide data (columns as values) into tall data (rows), which is better for analysis.
Example: Turning monthly sales columns into a “Month” column and “Value” column.

❓Q9: Can you write custom logic in Power Query? If yes, how?
Answer:
Yes. You can use M code directly via the Advanced Editor or Formula Bar to write custom logic for filtering, column creation, and transformations.

❓Q10: How does Power Query handle null values?
Answer:
Power Query uses the null keyword to represent missing or blank values.
You can use it in conditions like:

m
Copy
Edit
if [Amount] = null then 0 else [Amount]
(Though in practice, use = null with care — you might need Value.IsNull())

🔬 Advanced Power Query Questions
❓Q11: Can Power Query refresh live data?
Answer:
Yes. If your source supports it (e.g., SQL Server, SharePoint, Web API), Power BI can refresh the data based on the latest content — either manually or on a schedule in the Power BI Service.

❓Q12: What’s the difference between “Table.Buffer” and normal referencing in Power Query?
Answer:
Table.Buffer forces Power Query to cache the data in memory, avoiding repeated queries to the source — useful for performance and consistency in complex transformations.

❓Q13: How does Power Query handle errors in data?
Answer:
You can:

Remove rows with errors (Home → Remove Rows → Remove Errors)

Replace error values using conditional logic

Preview errors (via the yellow error icon on cells)

❓Q14: What is parameterization in Power Query and why use it?
Answer:
Parameters let you dynamically change values like file paths, filters, or connection strings.
Useful for building reusable queries, templates, or user-driven filtering.

❓Q15: Can you sort or filter data in Power Query using dynamic values (like from a parameter)?
Answer:
Yes! You can use parameters as part of your filter conditions, folder paths, or logic in M code.
